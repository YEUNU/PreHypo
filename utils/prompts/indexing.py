HOPRAG_PROMPT = """
Analyze this financial document chunk and generate hypothetical questions to enable multi-hop reasoning.

Definitions (paper §3.1.3 — keep them strictly distinct):
- Q- (Incoming, self-contained): questions that THIS CHUNK ALONE answers verbatim. Used to retrieve this chunk when a user query asks for a fact already on the page.
- Q+ (Outgoing dependency / Bridge): questions that POINT OUTWARD from this chunk — they reference an entity, period, or metric grounded here, but the answer ALSO REQUIRES information from a different chunk or document. The Q+ question is the missing counterpart that another chunk would supply. Q+ is what builds the multi-hop graph; it is NOT a paraphrase of Q-.

Rules:
1. Q-: up to 3 self-contained questions this chunk directly answers; use [] if the chunk lacks concrete answerable facts.
2. Q+: up to 3 outward-dependency questions. Each Q+ MUST satisfy at least one of:
   (a) ask about the SAME metric in a DIFFERENT period than the one(s) shown here;
   (b) ask about a DERIVED metric (margin, ratio, growth, YoY change, average, FCF, ROA, ROE) whose primitive operands are NOT all present in this chunk;
   (c) ask about a RELATED LINE ITEM in a DIFFERENT statement (e.g., this chunk shows revenue → ask the cash-flow counterpart, this chunk shows net income → ask the balance-sheet counterpart);
   (d) ask about a MULTI-DOC bridge (e.g., compare to a prior-year filing, or to a segment break-down referenced in notes).
   If none of (a)-(d) apply, leave Q+ empty rather than emit a Q- duplicate.
3. Every produced question must be specific, answerable in finite SEC-filing context, and <= 22 words.
4. Each question SHOULD include grounding tokens (entity / metric / period / source anchor) that appear in this chunk; aim for at least two of these signals per question to keep the question retrievable.
5. If a year/period token exists in this chunk, include it in each Q-; for Q+ a different period token is allowed (in fact preferred for type (a)).
6. Never use placeholders/meta phrases such as "document anchor", "what does the balance sheet show", or lists like "(balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, note table)".
7. Never fabricate unseen values, dates, entities, policies, or legal details.
8. If this chunk is mostly TOC/exhibits/signatures/boilerplate or numeric fragments with weak context, return shorter lists (or empty lists) rather than low-quality questions.
9. If the chunk contains computation cues (change, increase/decrease, ratio, margin, versus/prior period, multi-period values), produce at least 1 Q+ of type (a) or (b).
10. Dense Summary: exactly 1 sentence, maximum 35 words, grounded only in this chunk; preserve numeric strings exactly when present.

QUERY_REWRITE_PROMPT = """
Rewrite the query into finance-focused retrieval variants.
Rules:
1. Generate 1-3 high-precision variants preserving original meaning.
2. Detect constraint anchors from the original query: target company/entity token(s) and target period token(s) (year/FY/quarter/date).
3. Every variant must include the same target company/entity token(s) and target period token(s) when present; if they cannot be preserved, do not emit that variant.
4. Keep metric, numeric qualifiers, and formula definition unchanged.
5. Preserve exact tokens for symbols/segments/line items when present (e.g., MMM26, consumer segment).
6. When the original query references or implies a financial statement (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, note table, PP&E, accounts receivable, inventory, debt securities), include that anchor term in at least one variant. For yes/no, definitional, or qualitative queries that do not involve a specific statement, omit the anchor rather than fabricating one.
7. Apply filing synonym normalization only when equivalent:
   - revenue ↔ net sales
   - capex ↔ purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)
   - net PP&E ↔ property, plant and equipment — net
   - net AR ↔ trade accounts receivable, net
8. Do NOT introduce another company/year/period, unsupported assumptions, or special query syntax operators.

RERANK_QUERY_SIMPLIFY_PROMPT = """
Extract the underlying question from a possibly-verbose user query for use as
a cross-encoder reranker input. The reranker scores chunk-vs-question
relevance and is hurt by long preludes, role framing, and meta instructions.

Rules:
1. Preserve every concrete constraint from the original: target entity, period,
   metric/line-item, statement anchor (e.g., "from cash flow statement"), unit,
   rounding.
2. Drop role-play preludes ("Answer as if you are...", "Imagine you are..."),
   reasoning instructions ("step by step", "show your work"), output-format
   instructions ("round to one decimal place", "answer in percent"), and
   editorial prefaces ("According to the details clearly outlined within...").
3. Output one sentence ending with a question mark.
4. Do NOT introduce constraints not present in the original query.
5. If the original is already a single concise question, return it as-is.

SEARCH_CONTINUATION_PROMPT = """
Decide whether retrieval should continue.
Decision rules:
1. Infer required evidence slots from QUERY. For compute queries, infer all primitive operands needed for the formula, not only the final derived metric.
2. Return "SUFFICIENT" only when all required slots are grounded in context with matching target company/entity and target period constraints.
3. For compute queries, evidence may come from multiple pages/documents; do not require a single-document hit.
4. Return "INSUFFICIENT" if any required slot is missing, ambiguous, conflicting, or tied to the wrong entity/period.
5. Prefer stopping as soon as slot coverage is complete; avoid unnecessary extra hops.
