"""Shared abstain-phrase detection for FinanceBench-style refusal scoring.

FinanceBench (Islam et al., arXiv:2311.11944) uses a human-annotated 3-way
taxonomy `Correct Answer | Incorrect Answer | Refusal` (visible in the
`label` field of the official result JSONLs at
https://github.com/patronus-ai/financebench/tree/main/results).

The local LLM-as-judge approximation distinguishes the same three categories
via `(llm_judge_score, hallucination, answer_attempted)`. Refusal detection
previously matched only the literal substring "insufficient evidence", which
is Hypo's pipeline-specific abstain phrase. HopRAG and naive baselines use
natural-language abstains ("I do not know", "the context does not contain
...") and were therefore mis-classified as `Incorrect Answer` (with inflated
`answer_attempted = 1`).

This module centralizes the abstain phrase list so `utils/metrics.py`,
`tools/benchmark_report.py`, and `cli/benchmark.py` apply the same rule.

# three RAG strategies' synthesis prompts converge on when CONTEXT lacks the
